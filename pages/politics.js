          <p className="text-xl text-gray-400 max-w-3xl">  
            This site is about technology, creation, and problem-solving. But since politics often comes up,  
            I want to be transparent about where I stand: I don’t vote. This isn’t apathy. It’s a deliberate choice.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">  
            Modern American politics doesn’t work like a system of collective problem-solving—it works like  
            a machine designed to manufacture division and loyalty. We’re told there are “two sides,” yet both  
            ultimately protect the same structure.  
          </p>  
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">  
            I’m not willing to feed that machine. Voting doesn’t challenge it—it legitimizes it.  
            It takes individual agency and funnels it into a spectacle built to radicalize, divide, and pacify.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">On Injustice</h2>  
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">  
            I’m not indifferent to injustice or the real travesties happening in the world. But more often than not,  
            those travesties are the direct product of the same political machine people insist I must participate in.  
            Supporting that system in the name of fighting injustice feels like treating an infection by feeding the disease.  
          </p>  
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">  
            Refusing to vote does not mean I’m “okay with it.” It means I see that real solutions won’t come  
            from choosing which faction of the same machine gets to steer.

            <strong>“What if the other side wins? Isn’t it your fault?”</strong>  
          </p>  
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">  
            A broken system breaking further is not the fault of those who refuse to reinforce it.  
            Responsibility lies with the system itself.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">  
            Not at all. Refusing to vote is not apathy—it’s clarity. It’s recognizing that change must  
            come from outside the ballot box.

            Instead of giving energy to party politics, I invest in building tools, sharing knowledge, and  
            creating communities that value transparency and respect. I believe technology, when approached  
            responsibly, offers more direct ways to shape the future than casting a vote in a broken system.

            I don’t vote because I refuse to confuse participation with agency. My energy belongs to creation,  
            not spectacle. That’s where I believe real progress happens.
